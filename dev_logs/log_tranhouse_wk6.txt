Duties:
* We have linked all car parts in our database to the pictures in a standard vehicle
* I embedded a search bar that statically allocates an array of car parts
            - Specific team members will replace this static array to the back end through Firebase
* The sliding swipe view to add car parts cut off the table view of the search table
* Search table can now sort by Car Part, Date, or price
* Search bar works for uppercase/lowercase

Results:
* Have a working prototype of the search bar
* The search bar table is resized according to whichever size of apple device.
